Heavenezer's Unown

This is the Pokémon fan font that feature all 28 variations of the writing-like psychic Pokémon creatures. Unlike most fonts I made, the character set is very limited and it only has duplicate capital and small letters, a question mark and an exclamation point plus the fan-made @ (at) symbol (but there are no numerals and few other punctuation are there). See the PDF file for the character set. I conceived that this is my first (and so far only) font based on the Pokémon franchise.

This font is free for all uses.
